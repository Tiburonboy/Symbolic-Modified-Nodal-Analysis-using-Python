# Bridged T-Coil

A circuit with a coupled inductor and a bridging capacitor.

Abstract from [The Bridged T-Coil [A Circuit for All Seasons]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7336651)

> The bridged T-coil, often simply called the T-coil, is a circuit topology that extends the bandwidth by a greater factor than does inductive peaking. Many high-speed amplifiers, line drivers, and input/output (I/O) interfaces in today?s wireline systems incorporate on-chip T-coils to deal with parasitic capacitances. ...
