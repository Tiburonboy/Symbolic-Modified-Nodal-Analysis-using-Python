# Example problems {#sec-Problems .unnumbered}

<!--
Update this section to include typical topics in circuit analysis

- Can MNA equations be turned into state variable equations? See page Haykin page 59
- explore sympy and scipy state variable functions
- consider a post talking about s-parameters

## Example problems
In the chapters that follow, the MNA procedure is used to generate network equations from a circuit's netlist. Since these equations and the solutions can be generated automatically by SymPy, what follows are chapters with lots of equations.

The table below is a list of the example problems with a short discription.
