| Wien bridge oscillator | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien_bridge_oscillator <br>Simple circuit <br>not so easy to make osc in LTSpice. Notebook started |
| Flyback circuit | Boost switch mode power supply (notebook not started) |
| Switched mode power supply | Do the LED driver fly back circuit, <br>see Analog Devices power management tools, <br>https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/power-management-tools.html |
When this example is completed add a comment in into about LTI circuits [Linear time-invariant system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_time-invariant_system)

| T-coil | A circuit with a coupled inductor and a bridging capacitor |

A T-coil uses a coupled inductor with a bridging capacitor to develop a constant impedance. Historically T-coils were used in wide band vacuum tube amplifiers and today they are commonly used in Transient Voltage Suppression (TVS) circuits.

| Active filters | move to other blog, Several of these started [Sallen–Key topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sallen%E2%80%93Key_topology) |
| Active inductor, Nullors, Gyrators, NICs, Current Conveyor | Where are these used?<br>Controlled Sources, Nullors, Active Gain Devices, Impedance Converters and Inverters (Gyrators, NICs, Current Conveyors)<br>See Op Amp circuit #2 or #2HP  See Haydak Chapter 13, for RC-NIC and RC gyrator filters  |
| Switched mode power supply | Do the LED driver fly back circuit, <br>see Analog Devices power management tools, <br>https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/power-management-tools.html |
| Diode circuit | Get network equations with R in place of diode and then substitute equations for diode in python |
| Transistor circuit | Get network equations with R’s in place of transistor and then substitute equations in python<br>Or look at an Op Amp model that can have C in the feedback loop |
