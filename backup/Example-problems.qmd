| Two amplifier RIAA Phone Preamp | This paper analyizes the circuit for the RIAA preamp. The preamplifier transfer function was used to calculate the Bode, impuse and step response plots. The Python results were compared to those from LTSpice. Deviation from the RIAA response curve was also examined. The sensitivity, Monte Carlo and worst case analysis for the preamplifier circuit was performed. |
| Two port parameters | This notebook describes the calculation of two port parameters derived from the circuit's netlist. |
| Thevenin equivalent circuit | The Thevenin equivalent circuit is the reduction of a linear one port circuit to a single source and impedance and is based on [Thevenin’s Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9venin%27s_theorem). |
