| T-coil | This notebook looks at a circuit called the T-coil. A T-coil uses a coupled inductor with a bridging capacitor to develop a constant impedance. Historically T-coils were used in wide band vacuum tube amplifiers and today they are commonly used in Transient Voltage Suppression (TVS) circuits. |
