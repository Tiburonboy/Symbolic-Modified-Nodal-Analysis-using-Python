# Introduction {#sec-Introduction}    
Circuit analysis and theory are fundamental to electrical engineering and is usually one of the first topics taught to electrical engineering students. The purpose of this book is to describe a circuit analysis method called [Modified Nodal Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_nodal_analysis) (MNA) implemented in Python that can provide frequency domain symbolic network equations for circuit analysis problems. The Python programming language along with its packages and libraries provide powerful computational tools that make solving math problems extremely easy with just a few lines of code. The Python library, SymPy, is used for symbolic mathematics and is the main library used to perform the types of circuit analysis problems described in this book.

For example, the following system of equations,

$- C_{1} s v_{2} + v_{1} \left(C_{1} s + C_{2} s + \frac{1}{R_{3}}\right) = 0$  
$- C_{1} s v_{1} + v_{2} \left(C_{1} s + \frac{1}{R_{2}}\right) - \frac{v_{3}}{R_{2}} = 0$  
$I_{V1} - \frac{v_{2}}{R_{2}} + \frac{v_{3}}{R_{2}} = 0$  
$v_{3} = V_{1}$ 

can be entered into Python to get the equations in matrix form:

```{python}
#| echo: false
import sys
from IPython.display import display, Markdown, Math, Latex
from sympy import *
import numpy as np
init_printing()
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
R2, C2, v1, C1, s, v3, v2, V1, R3, I_V1 = symbols('R2 C2 v1 C1 s v3 v2 V1 R3 I_V1')
A = Matrix([[C1*s + C2*s + 1/R3, -C1*s, 0, 0], [-C1*s, C1*s + 1/R2, -1/R2, 0], [0, -1/R2, 1/R2, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0]])
X = Matrix([v1, v2, v3, I_V1])
Z = Matrix([0, 0, 0, V1])

equ = Eq(A*X,Z)
equ
```

The system of equations can be easily solved to obtain a solution in symbolic form:

```{python}
#| echo: true
U_sym = solve(equ,X)
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
temp = ''
for i in U_sym.keys():
    temp += '${:s} = {:s}$<br>'.format(latex(i),latex(U_sym[i]))

Markdown(temp)
```

The numeric values for the components can be substituted for the symbols (reference designators) and the following solution is obtained, where s is the Laplace variable:

```{python}
Values = {R2:1000, R3:1000, C1:1e-6, C2:10e-6, V1:1}
equ1a = equ.subs(Values)
U = solve(equ1a,X)
```
The voltage at node #2 can be obtained: 
```{python}
H = U[v2]
H
```

Now we can solve for the roots of the denominator.
```{python}
num, denom = fraction(H) #returns numerator and denominator
solve(denom)
```
As you can see, matrix and polynomial math can be easily performed with hardly any effort.

## JupyterLab
All the validation and problem circuits are presented in JupyterLab notebooks and rendered into chapters by Quarto. 

**Variable names**  
I've tried to be consistent with the use of variable names throughout the Jupyter notebooks. Resistors, capacitors and inductors use R, L and C as reference designators. The names chosen for the other variables are listed in @tbl-variable-names

| Variable name | definition |
|---|---|
| NE_sym | Network equations, symbolic |
| NE | Network equations with component values  |
| NE_dc | Network equations with $s=0$  |
| NE_w1 | Network equations with $s=j \omega$ and $\omega$ equal to a numeric value |
| U_sym | The solution to the symbolic network equations |
| U | The solution to network equations with component values |
| U_ac | The solution to network equations at some frequency |
| H_sym | system transfer function, symbolic |
| H | System transfer function with component values |
| $V1, V2, etc.$ | Capital  letter V for independent voltage sources |
| $v_1, v_2, etc$ | Small letter v for the node voltages |
| $I1, I2, etc$ | Capital letter I for independent current sources  |
| E | Voltage controlled voltage source (VCVS) |
| F | Current controlled current source (CCCS) |
| G | Voltage controlled current source (VCCS) |
| H | Current controlled voltage source (CCVS) |
| K | Inductor coupling coefficient |
| M | Mutual inductance |
| O | Op Amp component |
| A | Connectivity matrix |
| X | Unknown voltages and currents vector |
| Z | Known voltages and currents vector |
: Variable names {#tbl-variable-names} {tbl-colwidths="[20,80]"}

**Large exponents**  
The values of the exponents can be very large in the numerical solution to the network equations when using real component values. Often you will see in engineering text books that the author uses normalized component values, where the values have been frequency and impedance scaled to a frequency of $\omega = 1$ and one of the resistors or other components normalized to a value of one. This keeps the numerical values obtained in the solution to the network equations from getting very large or small. 

Almost all platforms map Python floats to the IEEE754 double precision - 64 total bits. Using the sys package, the float information is reported as follows:

```{python}
#| echo: false
temp = str(sys.float_info)
temp = temp[temp.find("(")+1:temp.find(")")]
sys_float_info = temp.split(',')

for i in sys_float_info:
    print(i)
```

The maximum exponent that Python can use is 308. In this book, I'm going to let Python do the math and not worry about the size of the exponents. I suppose that large exponents don't become a problem as long as they remain under two digits.

## Practical network size for symbolic solutions
Test circuit number 4, @sec-test_4, has 26 branches, 13 nodes, 18 resistors, 4 independent sources and 4 dependent sources. A symbolic solution for this problem was taking too long on my i3 computer, so I interrupted the kernel, and proceeded with a numerical solution, which can be solved quite quickly. The complexity of a circuit can be reduced by letting some components have the same value, for example $R_1 = R_2 = R_3 = R$, which would reduce the number of symbols that are being manipulated. 

Another circuit, shown below, a 100 Hz low pass elliptic function filter, is an example of a circuit where the size of the symbolic expressions became too large and the number of terms too great to allow any reasonable interpenetration of the circuitâ€™s operation. The Python kernel needed to be interrupted during the symbolic solution. After actual component values are substituted into the network equations a numerical solution was easily obtained by SymPy, see @sec-elliptic-function for this circuit's notebook.

The net list for this circuit is:  
```
* Elliptic function VCVS LPF
R3 3 0 4750
R4 5 0 73.2e3
R1 4 1 9530
R2 5 4 9530
R7 2 7 10e3
C1 3 1 0.05e-6
C2 5 3 0.05e-6
C3 7 4 0.1e-6
C4 5 0 0.22e-6
C5 2 0 0.18e-6
O1 6 5 7
V1 1 0 1
R5 6 0 10e3
R6 7 6 44.2e3
```
The following circuit equations were generated by the MNA code in less than one second: 

$- C_{1} s v_{3} + I_{V1} + v_{1} \left(C_{1} s + \frac{1}{R_{1}}\right) - \frac{v_{4}}{R_{1}} = 0$  
$v_{2} \left(C_{5} s + \frac{1}{R_{7}}\right) - \frac{v_{7}}{R_{7}} = 0$  
$- C_{1} s v_{1} - C_{2} s v_{5} + v_{3} \left(C_{1} s + C_{2} s + \frac{1}{R_{3}}\right) = 0$  
$- C_{3} s v_{7} + v_{4} \left(C_{3} s + \frac{1}{R_{2}} + \frac{1}{R_{1}}\right) - \frac{v_{5}}{R_{2}} - \frac{v_{1}}{R_{1}} = 0$  
$- C_{2} s v_{3} + v_{5} \left(C_{2} s + C_{4} s + \frac{1}{R_{4}} + \frac{1}{R_{2}}\right) - \frac{v_{4}}{R_{2}} = 0$  
$v_{6} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{R_{6}} + \frac{1}{R_{5}}\right) - \frac{v_{7}}{R_{6}} = 0$  
$- C_{3} s v_{4} + I_{O} + v_{7} \left(C_{3} s + \frac{1}{R_{7}} + \frac{1}{R_{6}}\right) - \frac{v_{2}}{R_{7}} - \frac{v_{6}}{R_{6}} = 0$  
$v_{1} = V_{1}$  
$- v_{5} + v_{6} = 0$  

After about two hours running on an i3 machine a symbolic solution was obtained, but it's too long to display and doesn't offer too much insight into the function of the circuit.

After substituting numerical values for the components, the following solution for the voltage at node 2 was obtained in less than one second.

$\frac{4.30028181226968 \cdot \left(1.0784981875 \cdot 10^{-10} s^{3} + 2.263375 \cdot 10^{-7} s^{2} + 0.000474999999999999 s + 1.0\right)}{1.50943922351291 \cdot 10^{-12} s^{4} + 4.7350839034956 \cdot 10^{-9} s^{3} + 4.53071325287237 \cdot 10^{-6} s^{2} + 0.00311443743767615 s + 1.0}$  

See @sec-2nd-order-brf for a reduced complexity version of the schematic above, for which a symbolic solution was obtained in less than one second.

Python together with SymPy has enabled the ability to explore circuit analysis problems without having to resort to pages and pages of hand calculations and then to display the results with good looking graphics and equations.

## Linear and nonlinear circuits
The Python code in the book supports [linear circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_circuit) analysis. The element types - resistors, capacitors, inductors, independent and dependent sources are all linear, therefore the circuits that are modeled using these element types are linear circuits. A linear circuit is a circuit where the [superposition principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle) is valid.

Non-linear circuit elements, such as diodes and transistors, are not supported. It might be possible to modify the Python code to support non-linear circuit elements and generate valid network equations, but finding solutions to nonlinear network equations is difficult and outside the scope of this book.

## State variables
A topic that is sometimes included in engineering text books on circuit analysis is state variable analysis. State variable analysis is a method of describing the electrical network in terms of a set of first order differential equations, see @Hayt1978, chapter 17 and @Haykin1970, chapter 2. The normal form of the state equations and the analysis approach relies on a network topology where energy storage elements, typically the capacitors and inductors, are placed in the network tree and equations are written in normal form. Deriving a of state equations is not is not included in the scope of this book. Typically there is a state equation for each inductor and capacitor, whereas the MNA approach writes network equations based primarily on unknown node voltages.

## Pros and cons of MNA
The MNA approach is a suitable technique for hand analysis of small circuits as well as for computer analysis of larger circuits using the same algorithm as illustrated in this book. The only disadvantage of the MNA technique is that often additional equations are generated, when a smaller number would be sufficient. For students doing homework problems and solving sets of equations by hand, the extra equation or two, generated by the MNA technique makes matrix inversions much harder. Modern pocket scientific calculators that engineering students now use can solve sets of linear equations relatively easily. However, some effort is required to enter the equations into the calculator. When a computer is used to generate the schematic for a circuit and the net list is exported to the Python code, the extra equations that the MNA approach generates is not a practical concern. The Python code can quickly provide numerical solutions to the network equations, even when the network is too large for the Python code to generate symbolic solutions.
