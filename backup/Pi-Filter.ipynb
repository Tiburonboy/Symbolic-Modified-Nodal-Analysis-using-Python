    "## Introduction\n",
    "A question posted on [Electronics Stackexchange](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/681002/how-to-find-transfer-function-for-this-pi-filter-using-facts-method-with-6-react/681087#681087) by @user15174 looked interesting, he asked: \n",
    "\n",
    ">Am trying to apply the FACTS method to find out the transfer function for this circuit as shown below. This is a Pi-filter circuit with all its component parasitics and also including the source and load resistances. I would like to find out the transfer function of this circuit and match its plot from Mathcad with simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    ">First, to find out the zeros of the this transfer function by inspection, I placed all circuit elements in its high frequency state. I can observe the response Vout is still present. In that case, can I assume that this circuit has 6 zeros associated with it?\n",
    "\n",
    ">But as per the answer provided in this link, we have to place the other associated circuit element in its DC state and observe if the response is still present. Since this circuit has around 6 reactive elements, how do I decide which circuit element should be in DC State and which circuit element should be in high frequency state?\n",
    "\n",
    ">I was able to follow some examples done based on 2nd and 3rd order circuits shared in the above links. But with this circuit configuration and so many reactive elements, frankly am lost.\n",
    "It would be great if you could share some insight on how to derive the transfer function for this circuit including its poles and zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FACTS (Fast Analytical Circuits Techniques) method refers to a circuit analysis technique that enables engineers to obtain the transfer functions and input and output impedances of a circuit by inspection without resorting to too much algebra. The circuits offered as illustrations of the technique are small with one or two branches. I was able to find several references on-line describing the FACTS method. \n",

    "The answeres provided by the community involved reducing the circuit to Z1, Z2 and Z3 as shown in @fig-pi-filter-facts and then substituting back into the transfer function the impedances for each of the Z's. The assurtion made by the proponents of FACTS, is that brute force circuit analysis is complicated and error prone. The results of the brute force analysis are what the authors call high entropy expressions that offer little insight into the operation of the circuit. A low entropy expression allows one to naturally read the gains, poles and zeros of the expression, which is what FACTS aims to provide.   \n",
    "\n",
    "From what I gather, FACTS is a circuit analysis method where the transfer function is determined by some simple techniques and the poles and zeros of the transfer function are relatable to parts of the circuit and thereby some insight is gained into the operation of the circuit. But the simple techniques do take some practice and proficiency to master. The main advantage seems to be is the analysis technique can be quickly done with pencil and paper by hand without using a computer or calculator to solve several equations to find the node voltages. \n",

    "There are two answers provided by the community, user @user347817 provided a detailed and user Telsa23 provided a shorter answer, both are described below.\n",

    "## Circuit description\n",
    "@fig-pi-filter shows the schematic as I re-drew it with LTSpice. I numbered each of the nodes and made some changes to the reference designators. In the orginal question, no component values were provided. I set the component values so that the numerical values of the poles and zeros could be calculated and not be located at the same frequecies on the complex plane. The circuit is a three section ladder filter and these are sometimes called Pi filters because the connection represent the greek letter $\\pi$. $R_{In}$ and $R_{Out}$ are the input and out put impedances of the preceding and subsequent stages, so I relabled them as such. The questioneer didn't provide any explination about the application of this circuit or if the R's L's and C's are non-ideal models of the actual components. The circuit has 13 branches and 8 nodes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Circuit analysis\n",
    "MNA will be used to 'brute force' analyze the circuit and solve for the transfer function and find the poles and zeros using the power of Python and SymPy. Then a FACTS type analysis will be attempted, where the branches  of the Pi filter will be combined into an impedance and then the network will be solved. The proposed solutions offered by the comminity for the question calculated the transfer function from v2 to v8.   \n",

    "6) Linear Circuit Transfer Functions: An Introduction to Fast Analytical Techniques (IEEE Press) 1st Edition\n",
    "by Christophe P. Basso (Author)\n",
    "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1119236371\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Circuit Transfer Functions: An introduction to Fast Analytical Techniques teaches readers how to determine transfer functions of linear passive and active circuits by applying Fast Analytical Circuits Techniques. Building on their existing knowledge of classical loop/nodal analysis, the book improves and expands their skills to unveil transfer functions in a swift and efficient manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with simple examples, the author explains step-by-step how expressing circuits time constants in different configurations leads to writing transfer functions in a compact and insightful way. By learning how to organize numerators and denominators in the fastest possible way, readers will speed-up analysis and predict the frequency response of simple to complex circuits. In some cases, they will be able to derive the final expression by inspection, without writing a line of algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Emphasizes analysis through employing time constant-based methods discussed in other text books but not widely used or explained.\n",
    "- Develops current techniques on transfer functions, to fast analytical techniques leading to low-entropy transfer functions immediately exploitable for analysis purposes.\n",
    "- Covers calculation techniques pertinent to different fields, electrical, electronics, signal processing etc.\n",
    "- Describes how a technique is applied and demonstrates this through real design examples.\n",
    "- All Mathcad® files used in examples and problems are freely available for download.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal reference for electronics or electrical engineering professionals as well as BSEE and MSEE students, this book will help teach them how to: become skilled in the art of determining transfer function by using less algebra and obtaining results in a more effectual way; gain insight into a circuit’s operation by understanding how time constants rule dynamic responses; apply Fast Analytical Techniques to simple and complicated circuits, passive or active and be more efficient at solving problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the skills needed to be an analog circuit engineer, one of them is the ability to construct from a circuit diagram a representation of the behavior of the circuit. For linear circuits, the well-established general scheme has been to express behavior in the complex frequency or s-domain. The cause-effect, or input-output behavior of a circuit is its transfer function, and when expressed as a function of s, essentially all that circuit engineers are interested in can be found from it (including the time-domain response) - hence the importance of transfer functions expressed in the s-domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "Circuits can often be compartmentalized into stages with only one or two reactances in each stage. These circuits can be formidable to analyze for engineers unaccustomed to using much math, yet Basso’s book presents higher-level circuit theorems or methods that reduce their apparent complexity. Chapter one starts easy, explaining basic concepts such as a port, the four possible transfer functions (input-output combinations of voltage and current), voltage dividers, Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems, and how by shorting and opening circuits at the reactances, time constants can be found. These concepts form the “building blocks” for finding the three parameters of greatest interest: the transfer functions and input and output impedances. \n",

    "### Bode plot\n",
    "Use the SciPy function [bode](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.bode.html) to plot the magnitude and phase of the filter. In electrical engineering, a [Bode plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bode_plot) is a graph of the frequency response of a system. It is usually a combination of the magnitude (usually in decibels) of the frequency response and the phase shift. As originally conceived by Hendrik Wade Bode in the 1930s, the plot is an asymptotic approximation of the frequency response, using straight line segments. Bode plots are used to assess the stability of systems by finding the gain and phase margins."
