## About this book {.unnumbered}
This website is my online book - *Symbolic Modified Nodal Analysis using Python*. Symbolic circuit analysis is a circuit analysis method that derives network equations with the circuit elements represented by symbols and the topology of the circuit described by a netlist. [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) is a general purpose programming language with a large standard library and packages.

One of the first topics taught to electrical engineering students is basic electrical circuit analysis. This can be thought of as EE 101, and deals with circuit models not physical circuits. The current to voltage relationship for resistors is described by [Ohm’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law), $V=IR$, and current to voltage relationships for [capacitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor) and [inductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductor) can be described by the following differential equations:
$$i(t) = C \frac {\mathrm d v(t)}{\mathrm d t}$$
$$v(t)=L \frac {\mathrm d i(t)}{\mathrm d t}$$
Since differential equations are used to model capacitors and inductors, EE 101 is usually taught after courses in calculus and differential equations. If an electrical network has several branches or loops, then there is a family of equations that describe the circuit, and these are a system of differential equations. Most of the problems presented in textbooks are relatively simple since developing the differential equations and solving them in the time domain with pencil and paper is laborious. After subjecting their students to the rigors of time domain analysis, professors introduce phasors and frequency domain analysis using Laplace transformed circuit elements. Here the problem turns into an algebra problem and students wonder why so much classroom effort was placed on obtaining solutions by solving differential equations.

The circuit analysis technique presented in this book analyzes electrical circuits in the frequency domain. The inductors and capacitors in the circuit are replaced by their transformed values. Inductors are replace by their steady state Laplace value, $sL$, where L is the value of the inductor with units of henrys (named after [Joseph Henery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Henry)) and $s$ is the [Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform) variable equal to $j \omega$ where $j$ is the [imaginary number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number) and $\omega$ is the radian frequency. Capacitors in the circuit are replace by their steady state Laplace value, $\frac {1}{sC}$ where C is the value of the capacitor with units in farads (named after [Micheal Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday)).

There are 15 code validation test circuits along with a few project circuits. The chapters for each of the circuits can be referenced as examples of how to use my Python code to analyze electrical circuits.

<!--
comment on the following which are typical 1st year circuit analysis topics
resistive circuits
time domain solutions - differential equations inductor and capacitors are described by the derivative of current and voltage for each element type,
phasor analysis with sinusoidal excitations mostly algebraic solutions and complex quantities
state equations - state variables are the independent capacitor voltages and inductor currents. They satisfy the state equations resulting from Kirchhoff's voltage and current laws.
Fourier analysis

This book was written in [R MarkDown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) using plain text files and [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. The source files were rendered into a book using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. Quarto does a good job of formatting the documents into web pages for a book. Some of the lines of code and mathematical expressions are wider than the page and Quarto inserts a slider bar in the code or equation windows. Chapter and paragraph numbering are automatically generated by Quarto as well as the numbering of figures and tables.

I don't have a proof reader or professional editor for this project. Instead, I'm relying on the LibreOffice spell checker and the grammar and spell checker of Google Docs to help me with this part of the writing process.

Source code for this book is available [here](https://github.com/Tiburonboy/Symbolic-Modified-Nodal-Analysis-using-Python/tree/main/backup) and related material is located [here](https://github.com/Tiburonboy/Symbolic-modified-nodal-analysis)

### About the author
This book is published under the pseudonym Tiburonboy.

When I was about ten years old, my parents gave me an electronics kit for Christmas. It was a collection of resistors, capacitors, transistors and other assorted electronic components. The kit included about ten plans to build various circuits like an AM radio and audio oscillator. Ever since then I have been interested in radios and electronics.

After graduating from high school, my Dad asked me what I was going to study in college and I told him mathematics. He suggested that I study electrical engineering since engineers were more in demand than mathematicians and electrical engineering was very math oriented. This turned out to be the best advice he gave me, because for the next 37 years my interest in electronics has turned into a very rewarding career as an electrical engineer.

My first job after graduating from college was working as a civilian for the US Navy. For more than 40 years I have been designing electronic circuits for instrumentation and telemetry systems. I have five Patents and have published seven technical papers.
