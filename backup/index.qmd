This is the website is an online version of my book - *Symbolic Modified Nodal Analysis using Python*. Symbolic circuit analysis is a circuit analysis method that derives network equations with the circuit elements represented by symbols. 

This book was written in [R Mark Down](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) using plain text files and [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. The source files were rendered into a book using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

Source code is available [here](https://github.com/Tiburonboy/Symbolic-modified-nodal-analysis).
