## About this book {.unnumbered}
This is the website is an online version of my book - *Symbolic Modified Nodal Analysis using Python*. Symbolic circuit analysis is a circuit analysis method that derives network equations with the circuit elements represented by symbols and the topology of the circuit described by a netlist.

This book was written in [R MarkDown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) using plain text files and [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. The source files were rendered into a book using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

Source code is available [here](https://github.com/Tiburonboy/Symbolic-modified-nodal-analysis).

### Project ToDo List
Since this project is still under construction, I have a list of to dos.

- [ ] finish comments in SymMNA.py code
- [ ] fix spelling of netlist
- [ ] change usage of spice to SPICE and define
- [x] finish chapter 4
- [x] add summary to end of example notebook
- [x] have SymMNA return the netlist report
- [ ] use N for network equations (N_sym, N), U for solved equations and H for system functions
- [ ] In chapter 3, include the schematic capture procedure to generate the netlist
- [ ] think about removing netlist file load, just embed the netlist
- update status in /Quarto_projects/Symbolic-Modified-Nodal-Analysis-using-Python/draft_docs/To Do List.odt
- rewrite tests and problems using smna()
  - [ ] clean up narrative on all the tests
  - [ ] add comment to each test about generating a symbolic solution
  - [ ] review each schematic and remove spice directives  
  - [ ] test 14 and 15 need writeups
- [ ] remove double spaces at end of sentences, except for md lists
- [ ] rewrite Two amplifier RIAA phono preamp
- [ ] update two port notebook
- [ ] update Thevenin notebook
- Create new example problems
  - [ ] Superposition, polyphase and phasors
  - [ ] Laplace transforms
  - [ ] Transient circuit
  - [ ] non linear circuits, see YouTube [MNA Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPapfxzwsmI&list=PLlsTHbFeR7v0QG8Q4l6oc7d---eKKSKTz)
- [ ] finish Summary in state variable notebook
- [x] add narritave to Appendices chapter
- [x] why is 2nd order BRF in the appendix?
- [x] make change log a table
- [ ] spell and grammar check all files
