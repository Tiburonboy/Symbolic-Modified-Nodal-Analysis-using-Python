    "## Introduction\n",
    "This chapter is about a type of electronic oscillator called a Wien Bridge Oscillator. An electronic oscillator is a circuit that converts a direct current power source into an alternating current signal. Essentially, it generates a periodic, repetitive electrical signal. A [Wien Bridge oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien_bridge_oscillator) uses a frequency selective bridge circuit as the topology for the oscillator. The bridge circuit was originally developed by [Max Wien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Wien) in 1891 for impedance measurements. The bridge circuit consists of four resistors and two capacitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Studying electronic oscillators is fundamental for anyone wanting to learn about electronics. Oscillators are examples of circuits that utilize positive feedback. Many oscillators rely on resonant circuits (LC tanks or crystal resonators) to determine their frequency. Studying oscillators introduces concepts like frequency stability, phase noise and harmonic distortion, which are crucial for designing high-performance electronic systems. Understanding different oscillator types (RC, LC, crystal, VCOs, etc.) helps in selecting the right component for a specific application based on requirements for frequency range, stability, cost and power consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of MNA and Python can enable easy symbolic and numerical analysis of Wien Bridge oscillators."

    "## Circuit Description\n",
    "The circuit in @fig-wien_bridge_v0_sch is a Wien Bridge oscillator drawn to emphasize the bridge topology. A bridge circuit is a type of electrical circuit topology where two circuit branches are \"bridged\" by a third branch connected between them at an intermediate point. It's often visualized as an \"H\" or diamond shape. A bridge circuit essentially consists of two parallel voltage dividers sharing a common power source. A third branch, often containing a galvanometer (a sensitive current meter) or a voltmeter, connects the midpoints of these two voltage dividers. The key to many bridge circuits is the \"balance\" or \"null\" condition. When the bridge is balanced, the voltage potential at the midpoints of the two parallel branches is equal, meaning no current flows through the bridging branch (or the voltage difference across it is zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "The element values in the schematic have all been set to 1; in @sec-design-example, the element values will be determined. The components $R_1$, $R_2$ and $C_1$ and $C_2$ do not need to be of equal value, but if they are, some of the analysis is simplified. The circuit above is missing the amplitude stabilizing elements that are usually included in real world implementations of the Wien Bridge oscillator. See @sec-ltspice-simulation for a version of an actual implementation. \n",

    "## Open Loop Analysis\n",
    "The analysis presented here follows the same steps that can be found in @Budak1974. While most sophisticated control systems are closed-loop (meaning they use feedback), open-loop analysis is incredibly important for several reasons. The open-loop transfer function ($G(s)H(s)$ or just $G(s)$ if $H(s)=1$) represents the inherent dynamics of the system you are trying to control. By analyzing the open-loop circuit you can understand how the circuit responds to inputs without any corrective action from a feedback loop. This tells you about its natural gain, phase shift, time delays and stability characteristics in isolation. It helps in identifying poles and zeros that are inherent to the system.\n",

    "### Characteristic Equation\n",
    "In control systems engineering, the characteristic equation is a fundamental algebraic equation that plays a crucial role in understanding and analyzing the behavior, and most importantly, the stability of a dynamic system. The value $k=3$ was determined above. The roots of the characteristic equation directly reveal critical information about the system's dynamic response and stability. The roots of the characteristic equation are the poles of the closed-loop system. If a pair of roots lies exactly on the imaginary axis (with zero real part), the system is marginally stable. This usually means the system will oscillate continuously without decaying or growing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `solve` function can determine the roots of the characteristic equation. "

The value for $R_4$ was chosen a bit higher to keep the poles in the right hand plane over tolerance and temperature variations. This circuit can be simulated in LTSpice with the following file.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "This notebook has presented some of the analysis and calculations for the design of a Wien Bridge oscillator using Python and MNA. Oscillators are networks that produce a pair of imaginary axis poles. When a circuit has poles exactly on the imaginary axis (e.g., at $j\\omega_0$ and $-j\\omega_0$), it means that the system will exhibit a sustained, undamped oscillation at the frequency $\\omega_0$. There is no exponential decay or growth; the oscillations continue indefinitely. Oscillators are designed with positive feedback loops. This positive feedback, along with specific gain and phase conditions, put the system's poles onto the imaginary axis. Without this positive feedback, the poles would typically be in the left half of the s-plane (leading to stable, decaying responses)."
