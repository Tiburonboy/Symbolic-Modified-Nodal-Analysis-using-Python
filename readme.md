This book is self published and being done without the benefit of a proofreader or editor. Don’t be surprised if you find spelling mistakes or grammar errors. Although English is my native language, I’m not a good speller and I’m sure that you will find many spelling errors and typos. JupyterLab does not have a built-in spell checker, so the notebooks will contain spelling and grammar errors. As this book matures, I’ll go back and re-edit and proofread the chapters to add clarifications and corrections. New chapters for the book will be added to the Example Problems section.
